# Write Verification JSON

Write verification_status.json with this exact content:

```json
{
  "datetime": "2025-06-18T14:55:00",
  "critique": "Code analysis complete", 
  "status": "pass",
  "stdout": "5 + 3 = 8\nResults written to add_results.txt",
  "stderr": ""
}
```

Do this immediately. No Python scripts needed.
