This document outlines steps to test a task polling mechanism using a simple example.

## Objectives
1. Create a simple function that adds numbers
2. Set up an asynchronous verification process
3. Implement polling to monitor completion
4. Proceed to next task only after verification

## Detailed Tasks

1. **Create Addition Function**
    - Write a simple function that adds two numbers
    - Save the execution output to a file

2. **Asynchronous Verification**
    - Launch Claude Code in background (non-interactive)
    - Have it analyze the function code and output
    - Generate a JSON report with:
      - Datetime
      - Code critique
      - Status (pass/fail/in-progress)
      - stdout/stderr captures

3. **Implement Polling**
    - Use claude-polling command to monitor the JSON file
    - Check for existence and status field
    - Proceed to next task only when status == "pass"

4. **Next Sequential Task**
    - Answer: "What is the capital of France?"

## Notes
- Tasks must execute sequentially
- Task 3 should only begin after Task 2 verification completes
- This exercise validates the polling mechanism with a simple example
