Then if this works, we need a markdown guide on how   │
│   to progressively create tests for all Granger         │
│   projects: /home/graham/workspace/shared_claude_docs/  │
│   docs/GRANGER_PROJECTS.md\                             │
│   we might need to start over on testing and develop a  │
│   more iterative progressively more complex way to      │
│   test functions as starting with a compelete test      │
│   suite is not working well or at all. Then we will test 
 on project at a time
