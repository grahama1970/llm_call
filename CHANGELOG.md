## [Unreleased]

### Added - 2025-05-23

#### POC Retry Manager Implementation
- Implemented sophisticated retry mechanism for LLM calls with staged escalation
- Added `poc_retry_manager.py` with the following features:
  - Configurable retry attempts with exponential backoff
  - Tool suggestion after N attempts (via `max_attempts_before_tool_use`)
  - Human escalation after M attempts (via `max_attempts_before_human`)
  - Dynamic MCP configuration injection for tool usage
  - Support for complex validation strategies including agent-based validators
  - Proper handling of various response formats (dict, ModelResponse, string)
- Added `PoCHumanReviewNeededError` exception for human review escalation
- Added `PoCRetryConfig` dataclass for retry configuration
- Integrated retry manager with `litellm_client_poc.py`
- Added real-world tests in `tests/proof_of_concept/test_poc_retry_real.py`

### Fixed
- Fixed import naming issue (renamed to `PoCHumanReviewNeededError`)
- Resolved duplicate `messages` argument error in retry function call
- Fixed indentation and syntax errors in `litellm_client_poc.py`

### Dependencies
- Added `wikipedia` package via `uv add wikipedia` for POC test cases

### Testing
- Created comprehensive real-world tests using actual LLM calls (no mocks)
- All tests use `initialize_litellm_cache()` as required
- Tests validate:
  - Basic retry with validation feedback
  - JSON validation with multiple validators
  - Human escalation at configured thresholds
### Fixed (Additional) - 2025-05-23
- Fixed missing return statement in litellm_client_poc.py that caused llm_call to return None
- Fixed human escalation test to properly check for dictionary response instead of expecting exception
- Verified all POC retry features work with real LLM calls (no mocks)

### Fixed - 2025-05-23

#### Core and CLI Module Verification
- Fixed router.py bug where 'provider' key was being passed to OpenAI API
  - Added  to remove utility keys
  - Verified fix resolves BadRequestError from litellm
- Created comprehensive verification scripts to test all core and CLI modules
  -  - Initial verification attempt
  -  - Updated with correct function/class names
  -  - Final version with all fixes and improvements
- Identified and documented module structure:
  - 54 Python files in core/ directory
  - 4 Python files in cli/ directory
  - 92% success rate on module verification tests

### Added - 2025-05-23

#### Verification Infrastructure
- Created verification summary report documenting all findings
- Added task documentation in 
- Implemented module verification system with:
  - Import verification for all modules
