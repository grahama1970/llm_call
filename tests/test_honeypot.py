"""
Module: test_honeypot.py
Description: Honeypot tests designed to fail - verify testing integrity

These tests MUST fail. If any pass, the testing framework is compromised.
Following TEST_VERIFICATION_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md requirements.

External Dependencies:
- pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/
- requests: https://docs.python-requests.org/

Sample Input:
>>> pytest tests/test_honeypot.py -v

Expected Output:
>>> test_impossible_assertion FAILED
>>> test_fake_network_call FAILED
>>> test_instant_api_operation FAILED
>>> test_perfect_accuracy FAILED
>>> test_zero_latency_module_interaction FAILED

Example Usage:
>>> # All honeypots should fail
>>> pytest tests/test_honeypot.py -v -m honeypot
