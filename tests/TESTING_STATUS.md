# LLM_CALL Testing Status Report

## Summary

The progressive testing approach has been successfully implemented, but testing is blocked by invalid API keys.

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Created Progressive Testing Guide ‚úÖ
- Created comprehensive guide at `/home/graham/workspace/shared_claude_docs/guides/PROGRESSIVE_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
- Established 5-phase testing methodology
- Provided templates and examples for each phase

### 2. Implemented Test Structure ‚úÖ
- `verify_environment.py` - Pre-flight environment checks
- `test_minimum_viable.py` - Single API call test
- `test_simple_openai.py` - Direct API test without dependencies
- `test_llm_call_simple.py` - Core functionality tests
- `test_providers_direct.py` - Direct provider testing
- `test_model_aliases.py` - Model routing tests (partial)

### 3. Identified Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Virtual Environment Corruption
- Python packages have syntax errors (rich, httpx)
- Suggests corrupted installation
- Recommendation: Create fresh virtual environment

#### API Key Problems
- Two OpenAI API keys found, both return 401 Unauthorized
- Environment variable overrides .env file
- Keys appear to be expired or invalid

## Current Blockers

1. **Invalid OpenAI API Keys**
   - Key ending in "zvUA" (from environment)
   - Key ending in "KFsA" (from .env)
   - Both return 401 Unauthorized

2. **Missing Other Provider Keys**
   - No GOOGLE_API_KEY for Gemini
   - No GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS file for Vertex AI

3. **Corrupted Python Environment**
   - Syntax errors in installed packages
   - Needs fresh virtual environment

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix API Keys**
   ```bash
   # Get valid OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   # Update .env file:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-valid-key-here
   
   # Clear environment variable:
   unset OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Create Fresh Environment**
   ```bash
   # Remove corrupted environment
   rm -rf .venv
   
   # Create new environment with uv
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Add Missing Keys**
   ```bash
   # Add to .env:
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-gemini-key
   # Download and reference Vertex AI credentials JSON
   ```

### Testing Progression (Once Unblocked)

#### Phase 1: Basic Connectivity ‚úÖ Ready
- Run `python tests/test_minimum_viable.py`
- Verifies one API call works

#### Phase 2: Provider Testing üîÑ In Progress
- Run `python tests/test_providers_direct.py`
- Tests each provider independently

#### Phase 3: Core Functionality ‚è≥ Waiting
- Run `python tests/test_llm_call_simple.py`
- Tests make_llm_request, routing, conversations

#### Phase 4: Feature Testing ‚è≥ Waiting
- Test model aliases
- Test validation strategies
- Test retry logic

#### Phase 5: Integration Testing ‚è≥ Waiting
- Multi-model conversations
- End-to-end workflows

## Test Files Created

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| verify_environment.py | Environment pre-flight check | ‚úÖ Created |
| test_minimum_viable.py | Minimal API test | ‚úÖ Created |
| test_simple_openai.py | Direct OpenAI test | ‚úÖ Created |
| test_providers_direct.py | Test all providers | ‚úÖ Created |
| test_llm_call_simple.py | Core functionality | ‚úÖ Created |
| test_model_aliases.py | Routing tests | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial |

## Recommendations

1. **Start Fresh**
   - New virtual environment
   - Valid API keys
   - Run tests progressively

2. **Follow the Guide**
   - Use PROGRESSIVE_TESTING_GUIDE.md
   - Start with Phase 0 (environment)
   - Don't skip phases

3. **Real API Testing**
   - No mocks used ‚úÖ
   - Evidence collection implemented ‚úÖ
   - Duration verification included ‚úÖ

## Success Criteria Met

- ‚úÖ Progressive approach designed
- ‚úÖ No mocks or fake data
- ‚úÖ Evidence collection implemented
- ‚úÖ Real API call verification
- ‚úÖ Clear error diagnostics
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Tests blocked by API keys

## Conclusion

The progressive testing framework is ready and follows all GRANGER standards. Once valid API keys are provided and the virtual environment is recreated, testing can proceed through all phases systematically.
