Module: test_honeypot.py
Description: Honeypot tests designed to fail - verify testing integrity

These tests MUST fail. If they pass, the testing framework is compromised.
This is required by the Test Verification Template Guide.

External Dependencies:
- pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/
- requests: https://requests.readthedocs.io/

Sample Input:
>>> pytest test_honeypot.py -v
>>> # All tests should FAIL

Expected Output:
>>> test_impossible_assertion FAILED
>>> test_fake_network_call FAILED
>>> test_instant_api_operation FAILED

Example Usage:
>>> # These tests verify the testing framework is not using mocks
>>> pytest test_honeypot.py -v -m honeypot
