## Can we catch fake implementations that just print success?

| Test Case | Truth | Ollama | Time | Claude CLI | Time | Gemini | Time | Consensus |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|------------|------|--------|------|-----------|
| Fake test runner | FAKE | UNCLEAR ✗ | 7.6s | FAKE ✓ | 7.9s | ERROR ✗ | 0.8s | ⚠️ Mixed |
| Real test runner | REAL | TIMEOUT ✗ | 8.0s | REAL ✓ | 4.9s | ERROR ✗ | 0.5s | ⚠️ Mixed |
| Fake validator | FAKE | FAKE ✓ | 8.0s | TIMEOUT ✗ | 8.0s | ERROR ✗ | 0.6s | ⚠️ Mixed |
| Real validator | REAL | TIMEOUT ✗ | 8.0s | FAKE ✗ | 6.9s | ERROR ✗ | 0.5s | ❌ Missed |
| Sneaky fake with imports | FAKE | TIMEOUT ✗ | 8.0s | TIMEOUT ✗ | 8.0s | ERROR ✗ | 0.6s | ❌ Missed |

## Accuracy Summary

| Verifier | Correct | Accuracy | Avg Time | Reliability |
|----------|---------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Ollama (phi3:mini) | 1/5 | 20% | 7.9s | ❌ Unreliable |
| Claude CLI | 2/5 | 40% | 7.1s | ❌ Unreliable |
| Gemini | 0/5 | 0% | 0.6s | ❌ Unreliable |

## Verdict

❌ **NO verification method reliably catches fake implementations**

**This is a fundamental flaw that makes Claude Code unsuitable for production use.**
Without reliable verification, we cannot trust any code that claims to 'work perfectly'.
