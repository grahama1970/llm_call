# Request: Task Plan for Slash Command Effectiveness Test

## OBJECTIVE
Create a task plan to test which slash command type is more effective for Claude:
- **Type A:** 100% prompt-based (flexible text instructions Claude interprets)
- **Type B:** Scripted/coded (less flexible, executes specific code automatically)

## CLAUDE'S LIMITATIONS
- Loses focus on objectives frequently
- Cannot maintain context across complex tasks
- Needs extremely specific, iterative instructions
- Follows binary (yes/no) verification steps reliably
- Can execute commands and report actual results

## TEST CONTEXT
- **Reference file:** `/home/graham/workspace/experiments/llm_call/src/llm_call/usage/test_matrix/functional/usage_F1_6_perplexity_weather.py`
- **Task domain:** Creating/modifying usage functions for perplexity weather API
- **Current format:** Binary checkbox style from existing task plans

## REQUIRED TASK PLAN FORMAT
- Simple checkboxes for each step
- Binary verification (file exists? yes/no, command ran? yes/no)
- Anti-defeatist directives (prevent Claude from recommending service cancellation)
- Specific file paths and exact commands
- Focus on measuring which command type Claude actually uses

## SINGULAR PURPOSE
Determine definitively: Does Claude follow and execute prompt-based OR scripted slash commands more reliably in practice?

## DELIVERABLE NEEDED
A focused, step-by-step task plan that tests both command types and measures actual usage/effectiveness for this specific AI system.
