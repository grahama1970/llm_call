## Review and Clarity of Your Claude Code Slash Commands

Your slash commands are well-structured and follow best practices for Claude Code custom commands, including clear use of the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder and Markdown formatting[1][2][4][5]. They are understandable and actionable, but a few improvements can make them even more effective and user-friendly.

---

## General Observations

- **Clarity**: Both commands are clear in their intent and usage. The instructions, code samples, and usage examples make it easy for a user (or Claude) to understand what is expected.
- **Slash Command Syntax**: You are using the `/user:` prefix for personal commands, which matches the recommended structure[4].
- **Arguments**: The use of `$ARGUMENTS` is correct and will be replaced by whatever follows the command when invoked[1][2][4][5].
- **Documentation Links**: Providing direct links to relevant documentation is excellent for troubleshooting or further learning.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Conversational Framing and Simplicity

Claude Code slash commands work best when the prompt is direct, concise, and framed as a clear instruction or task[1][2][5]. Overly verbose or technical instructions can sometimes confuse the model or make the command harder to maintain.

**Suggestion:**  
- Move technical details (like code examples) to internal documentation or comments, not the command prompt itself.
- Use plain language for the main command body, focusing on what you want Claude to do.

### 2. Command Body Streamlining

#### **Perplexity Research Command**

**Current:**
> Research the following topic using Perplexity: $ARGUMENTS  
> ...  
> (followed by technical setup and code example)

**Improved Example:**
```
Research this topic using Perplexity: $ARGUMENTS

- Choose the most appropriate Perplexity model for the query (see docs if unsure).
- Use high reasoning effort for complex analysis.
- Always include sources in your results.
- If you encounter issues, refer to the project documentation.
```
*Keep technical setup (like loading .env or code snippets) in your project README or a separate developer doc, not in the slash command prompt itself[1][4][5].*

---

#### **Ask Gemini Flash Command**

**Current:**
> Ask Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model a question using Vertex AI: $ARGUMENTS  
> ...  
> (followed by technical setup and code example)

**Improved Example:**
```
Ask Gemini 1.5 Flash (Vertex AI) the following question: $ARGUMENTS

- Use a balanced temperature (around 0.7) and limit responses to 500 tokens.
- For complex reasoning, consider Gemini Pro instead.
- Ensure responses are clear and concise.
```
*Again, keep environment variable setup and code samples in your developer docs.*

---

### 3. Remove Redundant Instructions

- Loading environment variables and code usage are not needed in the command prompt itself; Claude Code slash commands are for instructing the AI, not for scripting environment setup[1][4][5].
- If you want to ensure error handling or specific parameters, state it as a guideline, not as code.

---

### 4. Add Expected Output and Error Handling Guidance

Explicitly state what a "good" answer looks like, e.g.:
- "Return a summary with sources for each claim."
- "If information is missing, state so clearly."

---

### 5. Confirm Slash Command Limitations

Currently, Claude cannot execute other slash commands from within a conversation; only the user can trigger them directly[6][8]. If you want to chain commands, you'll need to structure prompts accordingly or handle it outside of Claude.

---

## Final Example (Streamlined)

### Perplexity Research Command (`.claude/commands/perplexity-research.md`)
```
Research the following topic using Perplexity: $ARGUMENTS

- Select the most suitable Perplexity model for the task.
- Use high reasoning effort for complex queries.
- Always include sources for each claim.
- If results are inconclusive, state so clearly.
```

### Ask Gemini Flash Command (`.claude/commands/ask-gemini-flash.md`)
```
Ask Gemini 1.5 Flash (Vertex AI) the following question: $ARGUMENTS

- Respond clearly and concisely.
- Use a creative, yet accurate, tone (temperature ~0.7).
- Limit responses to 500 tokens.
- For complex questions, recommend Gemini Pro if needed.
```

## Summary Table

| Aspect            | Current State                | Recommendation                        |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Clarity           | Good, but verbose           | Use concise, direct instructions      |
| Technical Details | Included in prompt          | Move to developer docs                |
| Argument Use      | Correct (`$ARGUMENTS`)      | Keep as is                            |
| Output Guidance   | Implied                     | State expected output explicitly      |
| Error Handling    | Mentioned                   | Summarize as a guideline              |

## Conclusion

Your commands are already functional and clear, but can be improved by simplifying instructions, removing embedded code, and focusing the prompt on the AI's task. This aligns with best practices for Claude Code slash commands and will make them easier to maintain and use[1][2][4][5]. Nothing is fundamentally unclear, but these changes will make them even more robust and user-friendly.
