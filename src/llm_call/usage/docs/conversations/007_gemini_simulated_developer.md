**Defining the Objective**

I've started by breaking down the central command. My focus is on building a complete `README.md` document. I've identified the core goal: the creation of this file, which serves to describe the necessary steps for the project. My objective is clear; a functional `README.md`.


**Formulating the Structure**

I'm now mapping out the `README.md` structure. The initial plan includes a clear title, likely emphasizing the "Simulated Developer" concept. Then, sections for prerequisites, execution steps, and potential modifications. I'm aiming for brevity, ensuring each step is unambiguous and immediately actionable for our "Simulated Developer".


**Clarifying the Workflow**

I'm now refining the "Developer's Workflow" section. The "Simulated Developer" metaphor is crucial and drives the organization. I'm outlining how each step, like "getting a new task" and "writing the first draft," directly translates into actions a user performs with the code. This will be a step-by-step guide to executing the "developer's" work.


**Analyzing the Components**

I'm currently dissecting the "Simulated Developer" workflow and its link to the project files. The emphasis now is on the orchestrator's role and how it controls the flow. The goal is to create clear instructions for the user to modify the orchestrator script with the core logic. My focus has now shifted to the detailed steps for the user, providing before and after examples.


**Defining the Sections**

I'm finalizing the `README.md` outline, consolidating my thoughts. It will start with a direct title, "Simulating a Developer," to immediately convey the project's focus. I'll establish the "Simulated Developer" as the single, central viewpoint from the outset. The "Developer's Workflow" section, mapping actions to system components, will be key, along with the step-by-step guide to user modifications, and a clear explanation of the project's objective.


**Revising the Approach**

I'm now critically reviewing the core methodology. I'm refining the "Simulated Developer" focus by integrating the user's feedback, ensuring it guides them through the logic implementation step-by-step. I'm focusing on making the README clear and practical, steering away from abstract concepts, and making the output actionable. I'm now structuring all of my thoughts and planning.


**Synthesizing the Guide**

I'm now in the final review, solidifying the `README.md` content. I've emphasized the "Simulated Developer" as the primary lens, ensuring the document's focus is on practical execution. I'm prioritizing the structure of clear instruction for the user, so they know how to modify the orchestration. My goal is for clarity, following all user feedback and adhering to the length constraints.


You are absolutely correct to call out the over-complication and my struggle to provide a clear, actionable path forward. I apologize for that. Your analogy of the "simulated developer" is the perfect lens, and it cuts through all the unnecessary complexity.

Let's use it to create a single, clear, and practical guide. This file will explain exactly what needs to be done to the codebase to make it function as you've described. It is a plan for implementing the robust, self-healing logic we've discussed.

# A Practical Guide: Implementing the "Simulated Developer"

Let's discard all previous complexity. This project has one simple, pragmatic goal: **to create an automated system that mimics a good developer's workflow.**

-   When a developer needs a new piece of code, they **write a first draft**.
-   They immediately **test that draft**.
-   If it's broken, they **debug it and try again**.
-   Once it works, they **save it and reuse that exact code** in the future.
-   If that trusted code later breaks (due to changing requirements), they **delete the broken version and go back to writing and debugging**.

This is not revolutionary; it's reliable. Our system should do the same. This document outlines exactly how to modify the codebase to implement this logic.

## 1. The Core Logic: How the "Simulated Developer" Thinks

The "Orchestrator" (the master program that runs the task list) must be programmed with this simple, robust logic. For any task that requires an executable script (like `verify_script.py`), the Orchestrator must perform the following steps internally:

This is the **most important part of the entire project.**

```python
# This is the PSEUDO-CODE for the Orchestrator's internal logic.
# This logic is NOT in the task list; it IS the orchestrator.

function anOrchestratorNeedsToRun(script_task):
    script_path = script_task.path # e.g., "generated_scripts/verify_script.py"
    
    # --- Step 1: Check for existing, working code ---
    if os.path.exists(script_path):
        log(f"[CHECK] Found existing script: {script_path}. Verifying it.")
        
        # --- Step 2: Test the existing code ---
        is_working = execute_and_verify(script_path, script_task.args) # returns True if exit code is 0
        
        if is_working:
            log(f"[SUCCESS] Existing script worked. Using it.")
            return # The task is complete.
        else:
            log(f"[FAIL] Existing script is broken. Deleting it to force re-generation.")
            os.remove(script_path) # <-- CRITICAL DEBUGGING STEP

    # --- Step 3: Write the first draft (if no working version exists) ---
    log(f"[GENERATE] No working script found. Generating a new one from prompt.")
    
    # Use the flexible prompt to create the code
    new_code = call_llm_with_prompt(script_task.prompt_template, script_task.args)
    save_file(script_path, new_code)
    
    # --- Step 4: Immediately "unit test" the new draft ---
    log(f"[VERIFY] Testing the newly generated script.")
    is_working = execute_and_verify(script_path, script_task.args)
    
    if is_working:
        log(f"[SUCCESS] New script generated and verified successfully.")
        return # The task is complete.
    else:
        # <-- CRITICAL FAILURE POINT
        log(f"[FATAL] LLM failed to generate a working script. Halting workflow.")
        raise Exception("Failed to create a viable script for this task.")

```

## 2. Your Mission: The Necessary Code Changes

To make this project work, you must implement the logic above. Here is exactly what you need to edit.

### Step 1: Update the Orchestrator

The main program that reads and executes `001_claude_poll_verification_tasks.md` is your **Orchestrator**. It cannot be a "dumb" line-by-line executor. You must modify it so that when it encounters a specific type of task, it triggers the `anOrchestratorNeedsToRun` logic described above.

### Step 2: Update the Task List (`001_claude_poll_verification_tasks.md`)

Once your Orchestrator is "smarter," the task list can be made much clearer. You need to edit it to reflect the **intent**, not the low-level implementation.

**Change This (in Task 3):**

> **OLD INSTRUCTION (Tells the orchestrator *how*):**
> `Generate a new script named generated_scripts/verify_script.py by following the instructions in commands/claude-verify.md with these parameters: ...`

**To This:**

> **NEW INSTRUCTION (Tells the orchestrator *what*):**
> **`Ensure working script:`** `generated_scripts/verify_script.py`
> **`Using prompt template:`** `commands/claude-verify.md`
> **`With parameters:`** `code_file=..., result_file=..., ...`

This new wording is a clear signal to your smart Orchestrator to trigger its internal `anOrchestratorNeedsToRun` function for `verify_script.py`.

### Step 3: Update the `claude-poll.md` File

This file currently contains hardcoded Python. This represents a "pre-verified" script. To align it with our new logic, you have two options:

1.  **(Simple Option):** Leave it as is. The Orchestrator can have a special rule: "If the instruction is to create `poll_script.py`, use this known-good code template instead of a flexible prompt."
2.  **(Consistent Option):** Convert `claude-poll.md` into a prompt, just like `claude-verify.md`. It would be a very detailed prompt that says "Write a Python script that does exactly this...". This makes all script generation consistent, but is slightly slower for the polling script.

For a robust system, the **Simple Option** is better. It represents a a developer deciding, "I don't need to reinvent this polling logic; I'll use the standard library function."

## Conclusion

This project is a blueprint for an intelligent, resilient system. Its "magic" is not in some revolutionary AI concept. It's in the pragmatic, robust, and simple way it **simulates a developer.**

-   **The `commands/` directory** is the developer's knowledge and documentation.
-   **The `generated_scripts/` directory** is the developer's working code on their local machine.
-   **The Orchestrator's internal logic** is the developer's brain, deciding whether to write new code or use what already works.

Your task is to build that developer's brain into the Orchestrator. The rest of the files are the inputs and outputs for that process.
