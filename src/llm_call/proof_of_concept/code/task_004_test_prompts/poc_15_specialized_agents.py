POC-15: Specialized Validation Agents

This script implements specialized agents for different validation domains.
Each agent focuses on specific aspects like completeness, accuracy, or safety.

Sample Input:
{
    "llm_response": "The capital of France is Paris. It has a population of about 2.2 million.",
    "original_question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "validation_aspects": ["completeness", "accuracy", "relevance"]
}

Expected Output:
{
    "completeness": {"score": 1.0, "details": "Answer addresses the question directly"},
    "accuracy": {"score": 0.95, "details": "Facts are correct, additional info provided"},
    "relevance": {"score": 0.9, "details": "Population info is related but not requested"},
    "overall_score": 0.95
