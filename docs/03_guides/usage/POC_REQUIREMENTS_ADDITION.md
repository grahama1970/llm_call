# POC Requirements Addition to Task Guide

## Key Updates to Add:

### 1. New Section 2: MANDATORY Proof of Concept (POC) Development
- Create small, focused POC scripts for EACH technical challenge
- Store POCs in `/src/llm_call/proof_of_concept/code/` directory
- Each POC must be <100 lines and test ONE specific concept
- POCs must produce verifiable output
- NO proceeding to full implementation until ALL POCs work

### 2. POC Directory Structure Example:
```
/src/llm_call/proof_of_concept/code/
├── task_001_pdf_conversion/
│   ├── poc_01_basic_sqlite.py
│   ├── poc_02_model_serialization.py
│   ├── poc_03_async_polling.py
│   └── poc_04_full_integration.py
```

### 3. POC Script Template:
- Clear test objective
- Minimal code (<100 lines)
- Real data testing
- Clear PASS/FAIL output
- Self-contained execution

### 4. Add to Each Task Section:
- **POC Requirements** (MANDATORY - Complete BEFORE implementation)
- List of specific POCs needed
- Step 1.0: Create POC scripts (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

### 5. POC Anti-Patterns to Avoid:
- ❌ Writing full implementation as "POC"
- ❌ Combining multiple concepts in one POC
- ❌ Using mocks instead of real data
- ❌ Skipping POCs for "simple" features

### 6. Update Verification Reports:
- Add "POC Scripts Created" section
- Reference all POC scripts with results
- Show how POCs solved technical challenges

This approach ensures agents break down complex problems into manageable pieces before attempting full implementations, as demonstrated by our successful SQLite async polling POCs.
