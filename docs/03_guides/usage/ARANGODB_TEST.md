# ArangoDB Integration Test

This directory contains tools and scripts for testing the compatibility between marker's PDF export format and ArangoDB's import requirements.

## Purpose

The goal of this test is to:

1. Understand exactly what JSON structure and fields ArangoDB expects for document imports
2. Compare these requirements against marker's current output formats
3. Identify any gaps or inconsistencies that need to be addressed
4. Provide actionable recommendations for aligning marker's output with ArangoDB's requirements

## Available Scripts

### `analyze_arangodb_requirements.py`

This script provides instructions for:
- Querying ArangoDB about its PDF export requirements
- Analyzing marker's output format against these requirements
- Generating recommendations for aligning the formats

Usage:
```bash
# Get instructions for analyzing ArangoDB requirements
python analyze_arangodb_requirements.py

# Analyze marker's output against ArangoDB requirements (after saving ArangoDB's response)
python analyze_arangodb_requirements.py --analyze
```

Since the script requires interactive use of Claude, it provides detailed instructions rather than running the analysis automatically.

## Expected Output Files

The analysis process will generate two key files:

1. `arangodb_pdf_requirements.json` - Contains the detailed JSON structure and field requirements for ArangoDB imports
2. `output_compatibility_analysis.json` - Contains an analysis of the differences between marker's output and ArangoDB's requirements

## Technical Approach

The original approach was to use the marker-comms module to automate this process entirely. However, due to the need for interactive acceptance of the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag, we've provided a guided approach instead.

In a production environment with properly configured permissions, you could use the `query_arangodb_requirements.py` script to automate this process.

## Next Steps

After running the analysis:

1. Review the `output_compatibility_analysis.json` file for detailed recommendations
2. Implement the necessary changes to marker's output format
3. Test the modified output with ArangoDB's import process
4. Update the renderer as needed to ensure compatibility

## Key Files to Review

When analyzing the compatibility, focus on these files in the marker project:

1. `marker/renderers/arangodb_json.py` - The renderer for ArangoDB JSON format
2. `marker/renderers/hierarchical_json.py` - The hierarchical JSON output format
3. `marker/renderers/merged_json.py` - The merged JSON output format

## Potential Areas for Modification

Based on initial analysis, these areas might need modification:

1. Field naming conventions to match ArangoDB's expectations
2. Vector embedding format and dimensions
3. Relationship definitions between document entities
4. Metadata and identifier fields for linking
5. Hierarchical structure representation

By understanding and addressing these compatibility issues, we can ensure seamless integration between marker's PDF processing capabilities and ArangoDB's document storage and query capabilities.
