# Task 012: Run Comprehensive Verification

## Objective
Execute the comprehensive verification script to validate all core and CLI modules.

## Prerequisites
- All previous tasks (008-011) should be completed
- Redis must be running for cache initialization
- Virtual environment activated

## Commands to Execute

### 1. Run Latest Verification Script


### 2. Check Specific Module Categories


### 3. Generate Module Coverage Report


### 4. Test Fixed Issues


### 5. Run Integration Test


### 6. Generate Final Summary


## Expected Results
1. Comprehensive verification shows 35+ successes
2. Only 2-3 minor failures (test issues, not core functionality)
3. Router fix is verified (no provider key in params)
4. ValidationResult has correct attribute name
5. Integration tests pass
6. All critical components import successfully

## Success Criteria
- Verification script completes without crashing
- Success rate > 90%
- Router correctly removes provider key
- Basic LLM calls work (may need retry)
- All core imports succeed
- Integration test shows positive results

## Next Steps
If all tests pass:
1. Update documentation with current status
2. Create automated test suite
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
4. Plan for remaining untested modules

If tests fail:
1. Check error messages carefully
2. Verify Redis is running
3. Check API keys are valid
4. Review recent code changes
