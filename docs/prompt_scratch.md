Now I need to to thoroughly analyze pre-existing tests in /home/graham/workspace/experiments/llm_call/tests
and determine if we should start over, again. Please think hard on this as we have tried test 5x times before. We need to convert 
/home/graham/workspace/experiments/llm_call/LLM_CALL_COMPREHENSIVE_TEST_MATRIX.md into actual tests that are verified by Gemini according to 
/home/graham/workspace/shared_claude_docs/guides/TEST_VERIFICATION_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md or an amended version of the template guide






should we create a REact/Tailwind/ChadCN version     │
│   that complies with /home/graham/workspace/shared_cl  │
│   aude_docs/guides/2025_STYLE_GUIDE.md\                │
│   We want to use html verification

│ > the slash commands using llm_call needs to support   │
│   multimodal and regular calls, and specifiying the    │
│   model you want to use. the slash command needs to    │
│   be flexible by including parameters\                 │
│   /llm_call --query How many objects are in this image: /path/to/image --model max/opus
or
/llm_call --query Can you decribe the what is in the far left corner of the image: /path/to/image --model openai/gpt-4o-mini

or for a large corpus
/llm_call --query Can you find all contradictions in this corpus docuement /path/to/corpus/ --model vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20


Then if this works, we need a markdown guide on how   │
│   to progressively create tests for all Granger         │
│   projects: /home/graham/workspace/shared_claude_docs/  │
│   docs/GRANGER_PROJECTS.md\                             │
│   we might need to start over on testing and develop a  │
│   more iterative progressively more complex way to      │
│   test functions as starting with a compelete test      │
│   suite is not working well or at all. Then we will test 
 on project at a time
