ey Misalignments/Missing Pieces:

Source of Progress Information:

Current: The update_progress_while_waiting function (lines 176-202) displays progress based on a pre-defined, fixed list of progress_stages. It cycles through these messages at timed intervals. This is a simulation of progress.
Required: The progress display must be driven by actual status updates originating from the Claude process itself. This means the Claude process (or an intermediary it uses) needs to write its current status (e.g., "thinking", "analyzing", percentage complete, current step message) to a shared, persistent location. The claude-comms query command must then read from this location.
Interaction with the claude Subprocess for Status Updates:

Current: The claude subprocess is launched (line 222), and then the query command immediately calls process.communicate() (line 231). process.communicate() is a blocking call that waits for the subprocess to terminate and then returns its entire stdout and stderr. While communicate() is blocking, the separate progress_thread shows the simulated progress. There is no mechanism here for communicate() to yield intermediate status updates from the running Claude process.
Required: a. The claude command itself (the one being Popen'd) must be designed to report its progress externally while it's running. A good example of this is the pattern in your claude_comms.core.claude_popen.py script, which uses claude --output-format stream-json and conversation_store.update_message(...) to save ongoing progress. b. The claude-comms query command needs to launch this status-reporting Claude process and then, instead of just blocking on communicate(), it needs to enter a loop to poll the location where Claude is reporting its status.
Polling Mechanism:

Current: There is no polling logic within the query command that queries an external data store for Claude's real-time status. The update_progress_while_waiting thread is self-contained with its fixed messages.
Required: The main logic of the claude-comms query command (after starting the Claude subprocess and initializing the ProgressIndicator) needs to be a polling loop:
Repeatedly query the persistent store (e.g., conversation_store.get_latest_status(task_id)).
Use the fetched status (stage, message, percentage) to update the ModuleCommunicationProgress object (e.g., progress.update_progress(fetched_percentage, fetched_message) or progress.manual_update(fetched_stage, fetched_message)).
Sleep for a short interval (the poll interval).
Continue until the fetched status indicates the Claude process has completed or errored.
Overall Workflow of query command (lines 165-229):

Current:
Setup progress indicator.
Start progress_thread (shows simulated progress).
Start claude Popen.
Block on process.communicate() (wait for Claude to finish).
Stop progress_thread.
Show final result.
Required (Conceptual):
Setup progress indicator (ProgressIndicator and ModuleCommunicationProgress).
Generate a unique ID for this Claude task.
Start the status-reporting claude Popen process, passing it the unique task ID. This claude process will write its progress to conversation_store (or similar) using the task ID.
Enter a polling loop in the claude-comms query command: a. Fetch latest status from conversation_store using the task ID. b. Update the console progress display using the fetched status. c. If status is "complete" or "error", break loop. d. Sleep.
Fetch final result from conversation_store.
Optionally, process.wait() or process.communicate(timeout=short_timeout) on the Claude Popen process to ensure it has cleaned up and to get any final exit codes/stderr.
Show final result.
In summary, the "incorrect" aspect of the current code (lines 165-229) relative to your refined requirement is:

The existing progress display is a simulation for a synchronous command and is not integrated with any mechanism for the claude subprocess to report its actual, ongoing status to a persistent store, nor does the query command itself poll such a store to drive its display. The fundamental architecture of how the query command interacts with the claude process and how it determines what progress to show needs to change to support live polling of actual task status within the same CLI execution.

You'll need to:

Ensure the claude process launched by query writes its status to a shared, pollable location (like conversation_store, leveraging patterns from claude_popen.py).
Replace the update_progress_while_waiting logic and the process.communicate() blocking call with a polling loop in query that reads from this location and updates the ProgressIndicator.
