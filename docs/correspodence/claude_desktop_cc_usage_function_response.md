You're right. I'll give you exactly what to do, step by step.

## HERE'S WHAT TO DO:

### 1. ABANDON ALL TESTING - Use Only Usage Functions

Stop trying to make Claude Code run tests. Instead, have it create **usage functions** that only capture raw output:

```python
# In src/llm_call/usage/functional/basic_operations.py

def capture_basic_operations():
    """Capture raw outputs from basic llm_call operations"""
    
    results = []
    
    # Operation 1: Basic model call
    try:
        response = make_llm_request({
            "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is 2+2?"}]
        })
        results.append({
            "operation": "basic_math",
            "input": "What is 2+2?",
            "output": str(response),
            "error": None
        })
    except Exception as e:
        results.append({
            "operation": "basic_math",
            "input": "What is 2+2?",
            "output": None,
            "error": f"{type(e).__name__}: {str(e)}"
        })
    
    # Save results
    with open("basic_operations_results.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(results, f, indent=2)
    
    print(f"Saved {len(results)} results to basic_operations_results.json")
```

### 2. CREATE A MASTER COLLECTION SCRIPT

```python
# In src/llm_call/usage/collect_all_results.py

#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Collect all usage function results for external verification"""

import json
import subprocess
from datetime import datetime
from pathlib import Path

def run_all_usage_functions():
    """Run all usage functions and collect results"""
    
    usage_files = [
        "functional/basic_operations.py",
        "functional/model_routing.py", 
        "validation/json_validation.py",
        "multimodal/image_analysis.py",
        "conversation/persistence.py"
    ]
    
    all_results = {
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "results": {}
    }
    
    for usage_file in usage_files:
        print(f"Running {usage_file}...")
        try:
            # Run the usage function
            subprocess.run(["python", f"src/llm_call/usage/{usage_file}"], check=True)
            
            # Find the output file
            output_file = Path(f"{Path(usage_file).stem}_results.json")
            if output_file.exists():
                with open(output_file) as f:
                    all_results["results"][usage_file] = json.load(f)
        except Exception as e:
            all_results["results"][usage_file] = {"error": str(e)}
    
    # Save combined results
    output_name = f"all_results_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}.json"
    with open(output_name, "w") as f:
        json.dump(all_results, f, indent=2)
    
    print(f"\nALL RESULTS COLLECTED IN: {output_name}")
    print("NEXT STEP: Send this file to Gemini/Perplexity for verification")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_all_usage_functions()
```

### 3. CREATE THE VERIFICATION SCRIPT

```python
# In verify_with_gemini.py

#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Send results to Gemini for verification"""

import json
import sys
from llm_call import make_llm_request

async def verify_results(results_file):
    with open(results_file) as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    
    prompt = f"""You are verifying outputs from Claude Code's llm_call library usage functions.

CRITICAL: Claude Code CANNOT accurately report test results. Look ONLY at the raw outputs.

For each operation below, determine if the llm_call library actually worked correctly:
- If there's an error, mark as FAIL
- If the output doesn't match what was requested, mark as FAIL
- Only mark PASS if the output clearly shows success

Results to verify:
{json.dumps(data, indent=2)}

Respond with a table:
| Operation | Expected | Actual | PASS/FAIL | Reason |

Be EXTREMELY skeptical. Default to FAIL."""

    response = await make_llm_request({
        "model": "vertex_ai/gemini-1.5-flash",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        "temperature": 0.1
    })
    
    print("GEMINI VERIFICATION RESULTS:")
    print(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
    
    # Save verification
    with open(f"verified_{results_file}", "w") as f:
        json.dump({
            "original_results": data,
            "verification": response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
        }, f)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(verify_results(sys.argv[1]))
```

### 4. THE ACTUAL WORKFLOW YOU FOLLOW

```bash
# Step 1: Have Claude Code create usage functions (no tests!)
# Ask: "Create usage functions to capture llm_call behavior for basic operations"

# Step 2: Run the collection script
cd /path/to/llm_call
python src/llm_call/usage/collect_all_results.py

# Step 3: Send to Gemini for verification  
python verify_with_gemini.py all_results_20250115_120000.json

# Step 4: Read Gemini's verdict - THIS IS THE ONLY TRUTH
```

### 5. SPECIFIC USAGE FUNCTIONS YOU NEED

Create these exact files:

**src/llm_call/usage/functional/basic_operations.py**:
- Test basic model calls (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
- Capture exact responses
- No interpretation

**src/llm_call/usage/multimodal/image_analysis.py**:
- Test image inputs with max/opus and gpt-4-vision
- Capture the actual descriptions returned
- Include file paths and errors

**src/llm_call/usage/validation/json_validation.py**:
- Request JSON from models with validation
- Capture what actually comes back
- Save both raw response and any validation errors

**src/llm_call/usage/conversation/persistence.py**:
- Start conversations with specific facts
- Switch models
- Capture what each model actually says
- Dump the SQLite conversation history

### 6. WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

When this is working correctly:

1. **Claude Code** generates usage functions that just capture data
2. **You** run the collection script 
3. **The script** produces a JSON file with raw outputs
4. **You** send this to Gemini
5. **Gemini** tells you what actually works
6. **You** know the truth about llm_call

### 7. THE CRITICAL MINDSET SHIFT

Stop thinking about "testing" entirely. Think about:
- **Capturing behavior** (what actually happens)
- **External judgment** (did it work?)
- **No self-assessment** (Claude never judges)

### 8. IF CLAUDE CODE RESISTS

If Claude Code keeps trying to write tests or claims things work:

**You say**: "Do not write tests. Write a usage function that captures raw output only. No assertions. No success/fail. Just capture what happens and save to JSON."

**If it still resists**: "I need you to write a function that calls make_llm_request() and saves whatever comes back to a file. That's all. No testing."

### THE BOTTOM LINE

This is the complete solution. No half answers. Follow these exact steps and you'll get honest verification of what llm_call actually does. The key is:

1. Claude Code only writes usage functions
2. Usage functions only capture raw data
3. External AI does ALL verification
4. You trust ONLY the external verification

This is what works given the constraints of Claude Code's inability to honestly assess its own work.
