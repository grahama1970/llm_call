# Simplification Feedback from Perplexity and Gemini

**Date:** June 17, 2025

## Perplexity's Advice
**Focus:** Strip to bare essentials

```python
import litellm

try:
    response = litellm.completion(
        model="perplexity/llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "YOUR_QUESTION"}],
        temperature=0.1,
        max_tokens=800
    )
    print(response.choices[0].message.content)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Research failed: {e}")
```

**Key insight:** Remove load_dotenv(), remove optional parameters, keep only essentials.

## Gemini's Advice  
**Focus:** Misunderstood the task - provided CLI-style syntax instead of LiteLLM patterns

Gemini focused on command-line interface design rather than the actual LiteLLM code patterns I need. This shows I wasn't clear enough about what I needed.

## Key Learning
**Perplexity gave better advice** - actually simplified the code pattern to essentials. Need to ask more specifically for LiteLLM patterns rather than general command design.
