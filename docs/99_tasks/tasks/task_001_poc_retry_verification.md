# Task 001: POC Retry Manager Verification ⏳ In Progress

**Objective**: Verify and validate the POC retry manager implementation for sophisticated LLM call retry logic with staged escalation, tool suggestion, and human review features.

**Requirements**:
1. Validate all retry manager functionality works with real LLM calls
2. Ensure proper error handling and escalation at configured thresholds
3. Verify integration with litellm_client_poc.py
4. Confirm all tests pass without mocks or MagicMock
5. Document performance metrics and limitations

## Overview

The POC retry manager provides sophisticated retry logic for LLM calls including staged escalation, tool suggestion after N attempts, and human review after M attempts. This task verifies the implementation meets all requirements from the POC documentation.

**IMPORTANT**: 
1. Each sub-task MUST include creation of a verification report in `/docs/reports/` with actual command outputs and performance results.
2. Task 5 (Final Verification) enforces MANDATORY iteration on ALL incomplete tasks. The agent MUST continue working until 100% completion is achieved - no partial completion is acceptable.

## Research Summary

Based on the POC documentation provided, the retry manager must handle:
- Complex validation strategies including agent-based validators
- Dynamic MCP configuration injection
- Staged retry with configurable thresholds
- Proper context preservation across retries

## MANDATORY Research Process

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: For EACH task, the agent MUST:

1. **Use `perplexity_ask`** to research:
   - Current best practices for retry patterns in async Python
   - LLM retry strategies and exponential backoff
   - Error handling patterns for API calls
   - Validation strategy patterns

2. **Use `WebSearch`** to find:
   - GitHub repositories with LLM retry implementations
   - Production retry manager examples
   - LiteLLM retry patterns
   - Async validation strategies

3. **Document all findings** in task reports

Example Research Queries:
```
perplexity_ask: "LLM retry patterns exponential backoff 2025 python"
WebSearch: "site:github.com litellm retry validation strategies"
```
