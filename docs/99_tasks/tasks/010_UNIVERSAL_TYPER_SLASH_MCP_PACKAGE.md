# Task 010: Universal Typer Slash/MCP Package ⏳ Not Started

**Objective**: Package the v2_typer_automated solution into a pip-installable library, enabling any team within the organization to easily integrate their Typer CLIs with Slash/MCP systems. This task focuses on robust packaging, comprehensive documentation, and strategic rollout to maximize adoption.

**Requirements**:
1. Create pip-installable package for internal PyPI
2. Enable one-line integration for any Typer CLI
3. Comprehensive documentation for 30-minute adoption
4. Support for organization-wide rollout
5. Maintain zero-maintenance auto-generation
6. NO MOCKING - real validation only

## Overview

Our successful v2_typer_automated implementation demonstrated a paradigm shift: instead of building complex infrastructure, we use AUTO-GENERATION to create slash commands from existing CLIs. This reduced implementation from thousands of lines to ~50, with zero ongoing maintenance. This task packages that innovation for organization-wide benefit.

**Key Innovation**: The CLI is the single source of truth. All slash commands and MCP tools auto-generate from it, eliminating synchronization issues forever.

**IMPORTANT**: 
1. Each sub-task MUST include verification with REAL slash command execution and MCP integration.
2. Documentation must enable developers unfamiliar with the tool to integrate within 30 minutes.
3. Success is measured by adoption across multiple teams, not just technical completion.

## Research Summary

The v2_typer_automated approach proved that:
- Auto-generation eliminates maintenance overhead
- Simple solutions (15 lines) beat complex architectures
- Universal patterns enable broad adoption
- Single source of truth prevents drift

## MANDATORY Research Process

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: For EACH task, the agent MUST:

1. **Use `perplexity_ask`** to research:
   - Python packaging best practices 2025
   - Internal PyPI repository patterns
   - Developer adoption strategies
   - Documentation that drives usage

2. **Use `WebSearch`** to find:
   - GitHub examples of successful Python packages
   - Typer plugin architectures
   - Auto-generation patterns
   - Package testing strategies

3. **Document all findings** in task reports

Example Research Queries:
```
perplexity_ask: "Python package structure best practices 2025 pyproject.toml"
WebSearch: "site:github.com typer plugin package structure"
perplexity_ask: "developer tool adoption strategies documentation"
```
