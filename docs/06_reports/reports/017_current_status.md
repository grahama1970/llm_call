# Task 017: V4 Essential Prompts Verification - Current Status

## Executive Summary

Task 017 aimed to verify all 8 essential test prompts work correctly with the new async polling implementation. Currently, only 1 of 10 sub-tasks has been completed due to critical implementation issues.

## Work Completed

### ‚úÖ Task 0: Environment Setup
- Read and understood CLAUDE.md requirements
- Verified Python 3.10.11 environment
- Located async implementation files
- Identified proxy server running on port 3010

### ‚ùå Task 1: max_text_001_simple_question Test
- Created test runner scripts
- Identified critical issues:
  - SQLite parameter binding error in async_polling_manager.py
  - Proxy server returning 500 errors
  - Claude CLI exiting with code 1
  - Response format mismatch
- Created detailed verification report

## Critical Blockers

1. **Async Polling Manager Issues**:
   - Task IDs being passed as dictionaries causing SQLite errors
   - No automatic waiting for task completion
   - Active tasks not being cleaned up properly

2. **Proxy Server Failures**:
   - Claude CLI integration broken
   - All requests returning 500 Internal Server Error
   - MCP workspace issues suspected

3. **Response Format Problems**:
   - Expected: LiteLLM ModelResponse
   - Actual: Raw task ID strings
   - Validation cannot process current format

## Immediate Next Steps

Before any further testing can proceed:

1. Fix the async_polling_manager.py SQLite issue
2. Debug and fix the proxy server Claude CLI integration
3. Implement proper response format handling
4. Add task completion waiting logic

## Recommendation

The current implementation has fundamental issues that prevent any tests from passing. These must be resolved before continuing with the remaining 7 test cases. The async polling concept is sound, but the implementation needs debugging.

## Files Created
- `/docs/reports/017_task_1_simple_question.md` - Detailed findings from first test
- `/docs/reports/017_task_10_completion_matrix.md` - Current completion status
- Various test scripts in project root for debugging

**Status**: üî¥ BLOCKED - Critical fixes required before progress can continue
