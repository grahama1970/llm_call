# Project Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2025-01-25

### Overview
Completed comprehensive project cleanup and organization as requested. The project structure is now well-organized with clear separation between source code, tests, documentation, and archives.

### Actions Taken

#### 1. Directory Structure Creation
- Created `logs/` directory for log files
- Created `archive/` with subdirectories:
  - `archive/debug/` for debug files
  - `archive/poc/` for proof-of-concept files
  - `archive/temp/` for temporary files

#### 2. File Organization
- **Log Files**: Database files are already properly placed in `logs/`
- **Research Documentation**: Moved `retry_escalation_research.md` from POC to `docs/research/`
- **Test Strategy Docs**: Moved `CLI_TEST_STRATEGY.md` to `docs/testing/`
- **Task Plans**: Moved `V4_COMPLETION_ACTION_PLAN.md` to `docs/tasks/`

#### 3. Test Directory Restructuring
Created missing test directories to mirror src structure:
- `tests/llm_call/core/api/`
- `tests/llm_call/core/config/`
- `tests/llm_call/core/providers/claude/`
- `tests/llm_call/core/utils/`
- `tests/llm_call/core/validation/builtin_strategies/`

Added `__init__.py` files to all new test directories.

#### 4. Documentation Updates
Created comprehensive `tests/README.md` with:
- Clear test organization structure
- Running test instructions
- Test categories explanation
- Writing new tests guidelines
- CI/CD integration notes
- Debugging tips
- Performance testing guidance
- Common issues and solutions

```

### Files Requiring No Action
The following files were reviewed and found to be appropriately placed:
- Root configuration files: `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `pytest.ini`
- Project documentation: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- MCP configuration: `.mcp.json`
- Utility scripts in `scripts/`
- POC files already in `src/llm_call/proof_of_concept/`

### Recommendations
1. Consider periodically archiving old POC files from `src/llm_call/proof_of_concept/` to `archive/poc/`
2. Set up automated log rotation for files in `logs/`
3. Add pre-commit hooks to ensure new files follow the organization structure
4. Consider adding a `CONTRIBUTING.md` guide that references this structure

### Verification
All changes have been verified:
- ✅ Test directories mirror source structure
- ✅ Documentation is organized by category
- ✅ No stray files in project root
- ✅ Tests README provides clear guidance
- ✅ Archive structure ready for future use
