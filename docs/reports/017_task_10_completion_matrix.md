## Overall Completion: 10% (1/10 tasks)

## Critical Issues Preventing Progress

### 1. SQLite Parameter Binding Error
```
sqlite3.InterfaceError: Error binding parameter 0 - probably unsupported type.
```
- Location: async_polling_manager.py:350
- Cause: Task ID being passed as dictionary instead of string
- Impact: Cannot retrieve task status, blocking all async operations

### 2. Proxy Server Claude CLI Failure
```
{"detail":"Failed to get response from Claude CLI"}
Claude exited with code 1
```
- Location: poc_claude_proxy_server.py
- Cause: Claude CLI execution failing
- Impact: No LLM responses possible, all tests will fail

### 3. Response Format Mismatch
- Expected: LiteLLM ModelResponse object
- Actual: Task ID string
- Impact: Validation logic cannot process responses

## Required Fixes Before Continuing

1. **Fix async_polling_manager.py**:
   - Ensure task IDs are strings, not dictionaries
   - Fix SQLite parameter binding in _load_task method
   - Add proper error handling for database operations

2. **Debug proxy server**:
   - Check Claude CLI installation and configuration
   - Verify MCP workspace permissions
   - Add better error logging for CLI failures

3. **Fix response handling**:
   - Implement proper waiting for async tasks
   - Ensure response format matches expectations
   - Add automatic polling completion detection

## Iteration Plan

Since only 10% of tasks are complete and critical blocking issues exist, I must:

1. First resolve the implementation issues preventing any tests from passing
2. Then systematically execute each test case
3. Document results for each test
4. Continue iterating until 100% completion

**CRITICAL**: Per Task 10 requirements, I cannot mark this task complete until ALL sub-tasks pass with verified working functionality.
