# Async SQLite Polling Implementation Report

## Summary

Successfully implemented async SQLite polling for the Claude proxy server, enabling agents to receive frequent updates from Claude instances through a robust polling mechanism.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Claude Proxy Server (`poc_claude_proxy_with_polling.py`)

- **Port**: 3010 (matching the running POC server configuration)
- **Database**: SQLite at `logs/llm_polling_tasks.db`
- **Features**:
  - Async task submission with immediate task_id return
  - Real-time progress tracking during Claude CLI execution
  - Polling endpoints for status checking
  - Support for both polling and sync modes
  - MCP (Model Context Protocol) configuration support

### 2. Polling Endpoints

```
POST /v1/chat/completions
  - Standard OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  - Additional parameters:
    - polling_mode: boolean (if true, returns task_id immediately)
    - timeout: float (max wait time for sync mode)

GET /v1/polling/status/{task_id}
  - Check status of a specific task
  - Returns: task_id, status, progress, result/error

POST /v1/polling/cancel/{task_id}
  - Cancel a running task

GET /v1/polling/active
  - List all active tasks with their status
```

### 3. AsyncPollingManager Features

- Uses pure asyncio patterns (no threads)
- Semaphore-based concurrency control (max 5 concurrent tasks)
- SQLite persistence for task state
- Automatic cleanup of old tasks (24-hour retention)
- Progress tracking with updates stored in database

### 4. Task Status Flow

```
PENDING -> RUNNING -> COMPLETED/FAILED/TIMEOUT/CANCELLED
```

### 5. Test Results

All core functionality verified:
- ✅ Polling mode returns task_id immediately
- ✅ Status can be checked via polling endpoints
- ✅ Tasks complete and results are retrievable
- ✅ Progress updates tracked in SQLite
- ✅ Multiple concurrent tasks supported
- ✅ Task cancellation works
- ✅ SQLite persistence verified

## Usage Examples

### Polling Mode (Immediate Return)
```python
response = await client.post(
    "http://127.0.0.1:3010/v1/chat/completions",
    json={
        "model": "max/text-general",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
        "polling_mode": True
    }
)
# Returns: {"task_id": "...", "status": "pending", "polling_url": "..."}

# Check status
status = await client.get(f"/v1/polling/status/{task_id}")
```

### Sync Mode (Wait for Completion)
```python
response = await client.post(
    "http://127.0.0.1:3010/v1/chat/completions",
    json={
        "model": "max/text-general",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
        "polling_mode": False,
        "timeout": 60
    }
)
# Returns: Complete OpenAI-compatible response
```

## Benefits for Agents

1. **Non-blocking Operations**: Agents can submit tasks and continue other work
2. **Progress Visibility**: Real-time updates on Claude's processing status
3. **Resource Management**: Controlled concurrency prevents overload
4. **Reliability**: SQLite persistence ensures no task loss
5. **Scalability**: Async architecture handles multiple concurrent requests efficiently

## Running the Enhanced Server

```bash
cd /home/graham/workspace/experiments/claude_max_proxy
python src/llm_call/proof_of_concept/poc_claude_proxy_with_polling.py
```

## Future Enhancements

1. WebSocket support for real-time push notifications
2. Task priority queuing
3. Detailed progress tracking for tool executions
4. Metrics and monitoring dashboard
5. Integration with the main router system

## Conclusion

The async SQLite polling implementation successfully addresses the requirement for agents to receive frequent updates from Claude instances. The system is production-ready for POC usage and provides a solid foundation for further enhancements.
