## Question

I'm working with Claude Code on a Python project (llm_call - a universal LLM interface). Claude Code has a fundamental limitation where it cannot accurately report test results - it consistently claims tests pass when they fail.

Given this limitation:
1. Should we convert pytest tests to usage functions with inline assertions (if __name__ == '__main__' blocks)?
2. Would usage functions with explicit print statements and sys.exit(1) on failure be more reliable?
3. What's the best practice for debugging/testing when the AI assistant cannot be trusted to report results?

The project is straightforward - routing LLM calls to different providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). We need a reliable way to verify functionality.

## Gemini's Response

This is a tricky situation. You've identified a critical flaw in using Claude Code: its inability to accurately report test results. This necessitates a shift in your testing and debugging strategy. Here's a breakdown of how to address your questions and a recommended approach:

**1. Should we convert pytest tests to usage functions with inline assertions (if __name__ == '__main__' blocks)?**

*   **Potentially, but with caveats.** This is a viable workaround, but it's not a direct replacement for proper testing.  Here's the breakdown:
    *   **Pros:**
        *   **Directly runnable:**  You can execute these functions directly and examine the output.
        *   **Simpler for Claude Code:**  It might be easier for Claude Code to understand and modify these functions compared to complex pytest structures.
        *   **Easier to inspect intermediate values:** You can print intermediate values during execution to debug.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   **Less structured than pytest:**  You lose the organization, reporting, and features of a dedicated testing framework.
        *   **More manual effort:**  You have to manually run the functions and interpret the output.
        *   **Risk of forgetting to run tests:**  Without pytest, it's easier to forget to execute all your tests regularly.
        *   **Harder to maintain:**  As the project grows, these inline tests can become unwieldy.

**2. Would usage functions with explicit print statements and sys.exit(1) on failure be more reliable?**

*   **Yes, this is a better approach than simple inline assertions.**  The `sys.exit(1)` is crucial for signaling failure in a way that's independent of Claude Code's reporting.
    *   **Pros:**
        *   **Clear failure indication:**  `sys.exit(1)` will cause the script to terminate with a non-zero exit code, which is a standard way to signal failure in a shell environment.  You can then check the exit code.
        *   **More reliable failure detection:**  Even if Claude Code misreports the execution, the exit code will accurately reflect whether the assertions passed.
        *   **Print statements help with debugging:** Detailed print statements before the `sys.exit(1)` can pinpoint the exact location and cause of the failure.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   **Still less structured than pytest:**  You still lack the full benefits of a testing framework.
        *   **Manual effort to run and verify:** You'll have to execute the script and check the exit code.

**3. What's the best practice for debugging/testing when the AI assistant cannot be trusted to report results?**

Here's a combined strategy:

1.  **Local Development and Execution:**
    *   **Write tests using either pytest (modified) or usage functions with `sys.exit(1)`:**  Choose the approach that best suits your needs, but prioritize the use of `sys.exit(1)` on failure for reliable failure detection.
    *   **Run tests LOCALLY:**  Crucially, **don't rely on Claude Code to run the tests**.  Run them on your own machine where you can directly inspect the output and exit codes.

2.  **Leverage Claude Code for Code Generation and Refactoring:**
    *   **Focus on code generation and refactoring tasks:**  Use Claude Code for what it's good at: writing code based on your instructions, suggesting improvements, and refactoring existing code.
    *   **Provide clear instructions and constraints:** Give Claude Code specific tasks with detailed instructions.  For example: "Implement a function that routes LLM calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, based on the `provider` argument.  The function should take the following arguments: `provider` (str), `prompt` (str), `api_key` (str).  Return the response from the LLM provider."
    *   **Manually review and test the generated code:**  After Claude Code generates or modifies code, **always manually review it thoroughly**.  Then, run your tests locally to verify its correctness.

3.  **Modified Pytest Approach (if you want to keep pytest):**

    *   **Run pytest locally:**  Execute `pytest` on your machine.
    *   **Capture stdout/stderr:** Use `pytest`'s output capturing features (e.g., `-s` flag to disable capturing) to see print statements from your tests.
    *   **Inspect the exit code:**  The exit code of the `pytest` command will indicate whether any tests failed (non-zero exit code).
    *   **Manually analyze the output:**  Examine the output in your terminal to see which tests failed and the associated error messages.

4.  **Comprehensive Logging:**

    *   **Add extensive logging to your code:**  Use the `logging` module in Python to log important events, function calls, variable values, and errors.  This will provide valuable information for debugging, even if Claude Code misreports the test results.

5.  **Version Control (Git):**

    *   **Use Git for version control:**  Commit your code frequently, especially after making changes with Claude Code. This allows you to easily revert to previous versions if something goes wrong.

**Example of Usage Function with `sys.exit(1)`:**

```python
import os
import sys
from llm_call import route_llm_call  # Assuming your main function is here

def test_openai():
    print("Running OpenAI test...")
    api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")  # Get API key from environment
    if not api_key:
        print("Error: OPENAI_API_KEY not set in environment.")
        sys.exit(1)

    try:
        response = route_llm_call("openai", "Say hello", api_key=api_key)
        print(f"OpenAI response: {response}")
        assert isinstance(response, str), "OpenAI response should be a string"
        assert "hello" in response.lower(), "OpenAI response should contain 'hello'"
        print("OpenAI test passed.")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"OpenAI test failed: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_openai()  # Run the OpenAI test
    print("All tests completed successfully.")
```

**How to Run and Check the Results:**

1.  **Save the code:**  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_llm.py`).
2.  **Set API keys:**  Make sure you have the necessary API keys set as environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
3.  **Run from the command line:**  `python test_llm.py`
4.  **Check the exit code:**  After the script finishes, check the exit code:
    *   **Linux/macOS:** `echo $?`
    *   **Windows:** `echo %ERRORLEVEL%`
    *   An exit code of `0` indicates success.  Any other value indicates failure.

**In summary:**  Ditch relying on Claude Code for accurate test reporting.  Focus on local execution, explicit failure signaling with `sys.exit(1)`, comprehensive logging, and manual review of Claude Code's output. This will give you a much more reliable way to verify the correctness of your LLM routing project. Use Claude Code as a *tool* to help you write code, but *you* are responsible for verifying that the code works.


## Analysis Summary

Based on Gemini's advice, here are the key takeaways:

1. **Usage Functions vs Pytest**: Keep pytest but verify externally

2. **Explicit Output**: Recommended

3. **Best Practices**: Look for external verification methods mentioned in the response above.
