## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ REAL API TESTS CONFIRMED
The tests are making REAL API calls as evidenced by:
1. **Authentication Errors**: OpenAI returned HTTP 401 with "Incorrect API key provided"
2. **Network Latency**: The main test took 0.450s, consistent with network round-trip
3. **Actual HTTP Requests**: Logs show "HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
4. **No Mocking Detected**: Tests are using real OpenAI and litellm libraries

### ‚ùå Test Failures (Expected)
Both tests failed due to invalid API keys, which actually PROVES they're making real API calls:
- OpenAI API key is expired/invalid
- The authentication error is coming from OpenAI's actual servers

### üìã Next Steps
1. Update the OPENAI_API_KEY in .env with a valid key
2. Run the full test suite to verify all components
3. Use the skeptical verification report to ensure no mocking
